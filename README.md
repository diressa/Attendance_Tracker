# Attendance Tracker
A website application that tracks the attendance of students through a QR-code login system. 
Professor and adminstator users have the ability to check a course's overall attendance report, generated from the updated 'attendanceTracker' database contents.

Prereqs:
1. SQL: To store attendance and login information in a database (MySQL Server was used).
2. Apache Server: To be able to connect the frontend PHP/HTML pages to the database.
3. A web browser to run the application- which will also be able to open the PHP files. 

On a MacOS device, setting up the application environment may require:
1. Homebrew: To start the Apache Server in command line using 'brew services start httpd' .
MAMP or XAMPP will also work as managers to test or manage the web application.
